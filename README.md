# Minecraft-Voxel-Engine

V Created a 3D voxel engine inspired by Minecraft using Python and OpenGL. Features real- 
time rendering, smooth controls (WASDQE for movement, mouse for camera), and chunk-based optimization for 
performance. 
o Technologies Used: Pygame, ModernGL, Numpy, PyGLM, Numba, OpenSimplex 
o User Controls: The movement controls include W, A, S, and D for forward, backward, left, and right navigation, 
while vertical motion is handled with Q to descend and E to ascend. The mouse is used for camera rotation, 
allowing smooth and intuitive looking around within the 3D environment.
